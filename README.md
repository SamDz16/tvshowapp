# TV SHOW APP
TV Show App is an application that allows to search tv shows based on user input. Each tv show is displayed in a Bulma* Card component and when clicked, heads you to the official tv show site

Bulma is a CSS framework that i experiment in this app and found it **very** interresting. More details on their official website: https://bulma.io/

Note: I am using The TV Maze API for extracting information, so be kind and don't spam their servers with a lot of requests:)
